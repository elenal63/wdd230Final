        <h2>How did we get started?</h2>
        <p>Sunshine Smoothies was founded in 1978 by husband and wife team Gabriela and Jose Sanchez. The two had immigrated to Southern California from Mexico in the early 1970s in search of better opportunities. Gabriela missed the fresh tropical fruit she had grown up with, while Jose worked at a market and noticed demand for healthier grab-and-go options. Starting off as a fruit stand at their local farmer's market in Carlsbad, Sunshine Smoothies quickly gained a following for its fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies made with produce sourced from small, local farms. Within a few years, Gabriela and Jose opened their first brick-and-mortar location in downtown Carlsbad to meet increasing demand. As Carlsbad's wellness-focused culture blossomed over subsequent decades, Sunshine Smoothies expanded into three more locations throughout northern San Diego County by 2000. Their son Marco took over leadership of the family company that year with plans to continue growth. He invested in organic certification of supply farms and introduced new superfood items like acai bowls and oat milk.</p>
